title: Thoughts on November
---

Currently, my greatest thoughts on November are:

1) Students on campus are fixated by Movember, the campaign to increase awareness of men's health (but often centres around who grows the 'best' moustache);

2) Daylight savings time and how disoriented I am with the early sunset;

3) Fear of impending Christmas music season and the personal identity crises that I often had as a child.
